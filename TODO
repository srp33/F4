[Me] Implement chunked writing in __save_rows_chunk in Builder.py.
[Me] Parallelize and chunkify the indexing logic.
[Me] Look at mmap settings to see if something might perform better and test it on large files.
[Me] Profile the parsing code: https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html
[Me] Remove ConvertTsvToFixedWidthFile3.py, TestBuild*.py?, TestParse*.py?
[Me] Remove commented code and complete all TODO items in code. Make sure all arguments to public functions are fully validated.
[Me] If possible, move functions out of Helper.py. If you keep any, document them.
[Me] Add documentation for all public functions.
  Mention .gz file support.
  Mention that if they specify tmp_dir_path, we assume that it is empty. It will not work if it is not.
[Me] Test building and parsing on gnomad/CADD files.
  gnomad: See notes in TickTick.
  CADD: Compare against tabix. We can also compare it in terms of size.
  Move to test.sh and generate formal statistics on it.

[MeLater] Support in_file_delimiter="," and out_file_type="csv"
  Change in_file_delimiter to in_file_type?
  Make sure exception when invalid value specified.
[MeLater] Store discrete data in separate table from numeric? The first column is a JSON dictionary that maps Unicode characters to unique values in the column. This could save a lot of disk space in most cases.
  When inferring column sizes and types, store missing values using a single character and replace them when the values are queried?
[MeLater] Set up readthedocs.
[MeLater] Look at pandas for other functionality that might make sense to support.
  Add to student's TODO list.
[MeLater] Support joins.

[Student] Rework the format so that everything is stored in a single file.
[Student] Add function to DataSetParser to return all unique values for a discrete column? Use this functionality in DataSetBuilder?
[Student] Add function to DataSetParser to get summary statistics for a numeric column?
[Student] Support date and string (has at least one non-number and more than 50% of values are unique?) columns.
[Student] Support conversion from pandas DataFrame to F4 and vice versa?
[Student] Provide explicit support for VCF format?
[Student] Provide a way to stream a file as input and/or output?

[StudentLater] Translate to Rust. Or create Rust/Python wrapper. https://crates.io/crates/pyo3
