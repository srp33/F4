[Me] Add parallelization support in Builder.
  Identify location(s) where parallelization can help.
  Add documentation for convert_delimited_file_to_f4. Mention .gz file support.
[Me] Add parallelization support in Parser.
  Identify location(s) where parallelization can help.
  Add documentation for convert_delimited_file_to_f4. Mention .gz file support.
[Me] Remove ConvertTsvToFixedWidthFile3.py
[Me] Test on gnomad/CADD files.
  gnomad: See notes in TickTick.
  CADD: Compare against tabix. We can also compare it in terms of size.
[Me] In DataSetBuilder, add transposed (compressed?) data.

[MeLater] Store discrete data in separate table from numeric? The first column is a JSON dictionary that maps Unicode characters to unique values in the column. This could save a lot of disk space in most cases.
[MeLater] Support OR logic for filtering.
[MeLater] Support inner joins?
[MeLater] Look at pandas for other functionality that might make sense to support.
  Add to student's TODO list.
[MeLater] Set up readthedocs.

[??] Rework the format so that everything is stored in a single file.

[Student] Add function to DataSetParser to return all unique values for a discrete column.
  Use this functionality in DataSetBuilder.
  Add documentation.
  Add validation. (Generalize the code for making sure column name is valid.)
[Student] Add function to DataSetParser to get summary statistics for a numeric column.
[Student] Support in_file_delimiter="," and out_file_type="csv"
  Change in_file_delimiter to in_file_type?
  Make sure exception when invalid value specified.
[Student] Support date columns.
[Student] Support conversion from pandas DataFrame to F4 and vice versa.
[Student] Provide explicit support for VCF format?
[Student] Provide a way to stream a file as input and/or output?

[StudentLater] Translate to Rust. Or create Rust/Python wrapper. https://crates.io/crates/pyo3
